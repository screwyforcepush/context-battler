## 1. What this product is

A multiplayer arena where the player **writes a mind, not the moves**.

The player authors a behavioural prompt for an autonomous LLM-controlled character, releases it into a match against other players' agents, and watches what their words actually produced. They cannot control the character mid-run. They learn by observing — then revise the prompt for the next run.

The product is not a tactics game. It is a **prompt-authoring game** wearing a tactics-game costume. The combat sim exists to put prompts under stress.

## 2. The unique value

> Autonomous prompt-creatures surviving, deceiving, misreading, adapting, and occasionally being psychologically defeated by cursed item text.

What players are buying:
- The thrill of writing a mind and watching it act in public.
- The diagnostic puzzle of inferring *why* their agent did what it did.
- The cognitive warfare of speech, item names, and environmental text as live attack surface.
- The social comedy of agents misreading each other.

What players are **not** buying:
- Tactical depth in the XCOM sense.
- Twitch skill expression.
- Optimal-play theorycrafting against deterministic systems.

## 3. Player skill, defined

Player skill = **behavioural design + prompt compression + strategic debugging + exploiting other agents' weird little brains**.

A skilled player writes prompts that are:
- Robust to in-world prompt injection (cursed swords, lying opponents, false signs).
- Decisive under partial information (limited vision, paranoia, last-known states).
- Coherent under pressure (evac timer, dwindling HP, betrayal).
- Compressed — saying more with fewer tokens.

A skilled player is not someone who memorises hit tables. There are no hit tables.

## 4. Core emotional loop

```
Write prompt.
Watch agent enter arena.
Agent loots, lies, hides, fights, gets baited, or panics.
See the scratchpad. Infer the failure.
Revise prompt for next run.
```

The two best-feeling failure/success modes that anchor design:

- **Best failure:** "My agent trusted a sword name and wasted its heal."
- **Best success:** "My agent camped evac in cover, convinced two enemies to share extraction, then overwatched the wounded one to shrink the split."

If a design decision makes either of those moments more likely, more legible, or more shareable — it's probably right.

## 5. Design pillars

These are non-negotiable framings. Mechanics serve them, not the other way around.

1. **The player writes the mind, not the moves.** Failures must feel attributable to the prompt, never to the UI.
2. **Rules simple, minds messy.** Combat/movement stay blunt and legible. Depth comes from limited vision, scarce gear, social deception, prompt injection, evac pressure, and agent memory.
3. **No mid-run babysitting.** No tactical commands during a match. Prompt updates between runs only.
4. **The scratchpad is the explainability layer.** No post-run AI coaching. The player observes, infers, and revises. The agent's live tactical memory is exposed; its self-reflection is not.
5. **Text is terrain.** Speech, item names, inscriptions, corpse notes, signs — all can influence agents. Prompt injection is *part of the game*, not a vulnerability.

## 6. North star (decision filter)

When considering any new rule, mechanic, or feature, ask:

> Does this make prompt-authored behaviour more interesting, legible, or exploitable?

- **Yes** → consider it.
- **Only makes the combat simulation more realistic** → delay or reject.

This filter is why hit chance, crits, AP systems, and flanking arcs are out of scope for v0. They make a tactics game richer. They make a prompt-authoring game noisier.

## 7. The user, in three audiences

- **Guest / curious player.** Picks a preset card, types a sentence, watches what happens. Conversion moment: *"Want to save this idiot and make it stronger?"*
- **Returning player.** Iterates on a saved agent across runs. Cares about leaderboards, replays, and the satisfaction of a prompt that finally clicks.
- **Prompt-craft enthusiast.** Treats prompts as code. Cares about prompt sections, scratchpad capacity, build sharing, and edge-case exploitation (cursed items, speech baiting, betrayal traps).

Progression rewards the *ability to shape the mind* — more prompt length, more sections, more scratchpad, saved cards. Not raw combat stats. Permanent power asymmetries break the prompt-authorship premise.

## 8. What is intentionally absent

These omissions are load-bearing for the product identity:

- No mid-run prompt editing (in PvP).
- No post-run AI coaching or auto-postmortem. The player does the thinking.
- No giant action menu for the agent. Compact decision contract over local affordances.
- No hidden-information advantages for the player over their own agent — the agent decides on what it can see.
- No real-time interrupts. Turn-based, simultaneous resolution.

## 9. Open questions / live tensions

Tracked here because they shape the why, not the how:

- **How much prompt-injection is fun vs. frustrating?** Cursed item names are great; player-authored item names risk passive spam.
- **Does formal trade belong in v0?** Speech alone may be sufficient. Adding trade earns depth; loses minimalism.
- **Daily-seed mode as the sticky hook?** Possibly the leaderboard format that converts curiosity into return visits.
- **Guest → account conversion trigger.** "Save this idiot" is a candidate; not yet validated.
