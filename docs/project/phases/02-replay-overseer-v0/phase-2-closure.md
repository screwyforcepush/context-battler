## Status banner

**Implementation: COMPLETE.** All four work packages (WP-A → WP-D) have
landed across four feature commits between dispatch (`7c22284`,
2026-05-08) and the post-implementation tip (`4db9757`, 2026-05-08); two
follow-up commits (`2833537`, `aee6397`) close the closure-readiness
must-fix bundle and reconcile docs. Engineering hygiene gates green at
root and at the `apps/replay/` sub-package: `npm run lint`,
`npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
(454 passed, 4 LIVE_AZURE-gated skips — 332 phase-1 + 122 phase-2
sub-package; phase-2 net adds 7 since the draft for the new
`TurnFeed.test.tsx` truncation suite). `apps/replay` Vite build:
130 modules, 79.51 KB gzipped. Substrate freeze (D-P2-9) verified —
empty diff over `convex/engine`, `convex/llm`, `convex/runMatch.ts`,
`convex/schema.ts`, `personas/*`, `harness/*` from dispatch through
`aee6397`.

**User vibe-judgement: PENDING.** The phase's success criterion is
qualitative — the user steps through three+ matches, confirms the
substrate produces watchable, attributable, prompt-driven behaviour
(north-star §COMPLETION CONDITION). Section 9 below is the placeholder
the user fills once that pass is done. Until that section is filled,
the phase is **not** marked closed.

This closure record covers the agent-verifiable surfaces only.
Browser-flow UAT against the user's Convex dev deployment (the agent
walk-through) is a precondition for the user signoff and is not
captured inline here — see §3 caveats.

## 1. Inventory of artefacts

Paths and one-line purposes — no invented descriptions; pulled from
file headers, test counts measured directly, and ADR-locked
boundaries. Full rationale lives in `architecture-decisions.md`.

```

Total: 122 Vitest tests inside the sub-package, all passing
(115 at draft + 7 added by closure-readiness for the
`truncateOneLine` helper).

`MatchPicker.tsx` additionally wraps its paginated query in a
local `PickerErrorBoundary` class component that renders a friendly
hint pointing at `npx convex dev` + `VITE_CONVEX_URL` when
`replay:listMatches` 404s against a deployment that has not yet pushed
`convex/replay.ts` (closure-readiness — UAT ISSUE-003b). The opaque
"last survivor" picker column was removed in the same pass per D-P2-21
(see §5 below).

### 1.2 Convex query module — `convex/replay.ts`

Renderer-only read surface (does not extend `convex/turns.ts` or
`convex/matches.ts` — keeps the slice boundary auditable in one
file per ADR §3):

- `replay.listMatches({ paginationOpts })` — paginated, completed-only,
  reverse-chronological. Uses `withIndex("by_status", q =>
  q.eq("status","completed")).order("desc")` against the existing
  `matches.by_status` index (`convex/schema.ts:461`). No schema diff.
- `replay.getReplayBundle({ matchId })` — single-batch fetch. Returns
  `{ match, turns[], characters[], worldState } | null`. Uses
  `turns.by_match_turn` (`convex/schema.ts:495`),
  `characters.by_match` (`convex/schema.ts:487`), and a `.filter() +
  .unique()` scan for the single `worldState` row (no `by_match`
  index — ~50 rows in dev, trivial).

The Convex codegen surfaces both via `api.replay.{listMatches,
getReplayBundle}` to the renderer's TypeScript build (the only diff in
`convex/_generated/api.d.ts`).

### 1.3 Test suites

| Suite | Count | Anchors |
|---|---:|---|
| `apps/replay/.../lib/__tests__/reconstruct.test.ts` | 25 | de-risking §1.1–§1.6 + §1.8–§1.9; §1.7 retired by D-P2-22; ADR §4 walk rules |
| `apps/replay/.../lib/__tests__/decisionEnglish.test.ts` | 51 | ADR §5 vocabulary table; canonical source `convex/engine/resolution.ts:374-586` (D-P2-14) |
| `apps/replay/.../lib/__tests__/formatters.test.ts` | 23 | usage/latency/scratchpad-diff helpers (pure) |
| `apps/replay/.../lib/__tests__/useHashRoute.test.ts` | 16 | hash-route parser (pure) |
| `apps/replay/.../components/__tests__/TurnFeed.test.tsx` | 7 | `truncateOneLine` boundary behaviour (closure-readiness — AC#7) |
| **Phase-2 sub-total** | **122** | tests-first per AOP for the pure modules + the truncation helper |
| Phase-1 carry-over (`tests/**`) | 332 + 4 skipped | `LIVE_AZURE`-gated skips unchanged from phase 1 |
| **Suite total** | **454 + 4 skipped** | matches phase-1 baseline (332) + phase-2 net adds (122) |

### 1.4 ESLint slice-boundary rule

`eslint.config.mjs:50-82` — `apps/replay/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` files block
runtime imports of `**/convex/engine/**`, `**/convex/llm/**`,
`**/convex/runMatch`, `**/convex/_internal_runMatch` via
`no-restricted-imports`, with `allowTypeImports: true` so type-only
imports across the slice continue to work (ADR §7). This is the
machine-enforced expression of architecture.md §1 / pillar 7
("renderer subscribes to State only").

### 1.5 Root tooling extensions

- `package.json` scripts:
  - `typecheck` extended to chain `npm --prefix apps/replay run typecheck`.
  - `build` extended likewise (renderer's `tsc --noEmit` is the build gate).
  - `dev:replay` → `npm --prefix apps/replay run dev` (Vite at `:5173`).
  - `build:replay` → sub-package `vite build` (130 modules, ~79 KB
    gzipped per implement-job report).
- `vitest.config.ts` — `include` extended with
  `apps/replay/src/**/*.test.ts(x)` so root `npm test` covers both
  packages (no separate command).
- `.gitignore` — `apps/replay/node_modules/`, `apps/replay/dist/`,
  `apps/replay/.env`.

## 2. ADR adherence summary

Each phase-2 decision (`D-P2-1`..`D-P2-23`, sourced from
`architecture-decisions.md` and the conversation Decision Record)
ticked off with one line of agent-verifiable evidence. Decisions
`D-P2-18`..`D-P2-23` are closure-readiness orchestration entries
recorded after the implement job; they do not have ADR-section
counterparts in `architecture-decisions.md`.

| ID | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| D-P2-1 | Tech stack: Vite + React + TS + inline SVG + `convex/react` | `apps/replay/package.json` (deps: react/react-dom/convex; devDeps: vite/@vitejs/plugin-react/typescript). `Grid.tsx` uses inline SVG. |
| D-P2-2 | App at top-level `apps/replay/`, not nested under harness or as a workspace member | `apps/replay/` exists as sibling of `convex/`, `harness/`, `personas/`. Root invokes via `npm --prefix apps/replay`. |
| D-P2-3 | New `convex/replay.ts` (does not extend `turns.ts`/`matches.ts`) | `convex/replay.ts` exports `listMatches` + `getReplayBundle`; `git diff 7c22284..HEAD -- convex/turns.ts convex/matches.ts` empty. |
| D-P2-4 | Renderer reads State only — runtime engine imports blocked at lint | `eslint.config.mjs:63-79` `no-restricted-imports` rule with `allowTypeImports: true`. |
| D-P2-5 | Pure `reconstruct.ts` walk — single source of non-trivial logic | `apps/replay/src/lib/reconstruct.ts` is import-free of React/DOM/Convex; 25 Vitest tests anchored to de-risking §1. |
| D-P2-6 | Persona prompt source = `agentRecord.input.personaPromptText` (per-row capture) | `ExpandModal.tsx:221` reads `personaPromptText`; no import of `personas/*.md` from the renderer. |
| D-P2-7 | Backward stepping is free — slider only, no separate Back button | `TurnStepper.tsx` exposes slider + Next; arrow keys ±1; no Back button. |
| D-P2-8 | Equipment-state per turn = best-effort; corpse contents from `worldState.corpses[]` | `reconstruct.ts` snapshot fields `equipped: null`, `hp: null` always; corpse contents read from `worldState.corpses[]`. |
| D-P2-9 | No engine, schema, persona, or harness changes | `git diff 7c22284..HEAD -- convex/engine convex/llm convex/runMatch.ts convex/schema.ts personas harness` produces zero output (see §4). |
| D-P2-10 | Success criterion = qualitative vibe-judgement on 3+ matches | Phase README §2 + this doc §9 placeholder; no quantitative bar enforced. |
| D-P2-11 | Live-agent equipment + HP not derivable per turn | `HoverCard.tsx:230-231` renders literal "see expand panel"; `reconstruct.ts` snapshot `equipped`/`hp` always `null`. |
| D-P2-12 | Opened-chest contents not persisted post-open | `HoverCard.tsx:296` renders literal "contents not persisted" for opened chests. |
| D-P2-13 | Turn 0 is synthetic; UI keys turns by **turn-number**, not array index | `reconstruct.ts:106-119` builds `turnRowByTurn = new Map<number, Doc<"turns">>()` keyed by `row.turn`; turn-0 path synthesises from `spawns[c.spawnIndex]` without consulting any ledger row. |
| D-P2-14 | Result-string vocabulary canonical source = `convex/engine/resolution.ts:374-586` | `decisionEnglish.ts:17` and inline ADR §5 vocabulary table reference resolution.ts line range; `harness/analyze-match.ts` is explicitly **not** a reference. |
| D-P2-15 | Plan refinement post-review approved without re-review | Reviewer-conditions met by direct engine-source verification per phase memory `feedback_verified_guides_are_contracts`; commit `93584a5`. |
| D-P2-16 | Phase 2 v0 dispatched as a single implement job covering all 4 WPs | One implement job; sequenced internally per `work-packages.md` dependency arrows; four commits 2f697cd → 4db9757. |
| D-P2-17 | Phase 2 v0 implement job COMPLETE | All four WP commits landed; gates green; this closure record filed. |
| D-P2-18 | First review-group findings: 4 AC-violating must-fix items (Grid fit-to-viewport / URL→state sync / scratchpad preview / parsed decision JSON) | All four resolved by closure-readiness commit `2833537`; details in §5.0 below. |
| D-P2-19 | Closure-completion path: single implement job lands must-fix + bundled-lower-priority + closure-doc, THEN COMPLETION REVIEW group dispatched | Honoured: `2833537` (code+README) + `aee6397` (docs) precede the COMPLETION REVIEW group; this current document pass is part of that group. |
| D-P2-20 | de-risking §1.8 wording aligned to `t >= extractedAtTurn` impl semantics (engine extracts in resolution phase 8) | `de-risking.md` §1.8 updated in `aee6397` with citation to `convex/engine/resolution.ts:711-723`; matches `Grid.tsx:207-212`. |
| D-P2-21 | Last-survivor column on MatchPicker dropped — enrichment would require N+1 worldState reads or a schema diff | `MatchPicker.tsx:1-31` doc-comment records the drop; remaining columns (matchId/startedAt/status/turn/extracted) satisfy AC#2 "enough context to choose". |
| D-P2-22 | de-risking §1.7 retired (not patched) — reconstruct.ts performs zero corpse-contents derivation; HoverCard reads `worldState.corpses[]` directly | `de-risking.md` §1.7 marked retired in `aee6397`; parallels D-P2-12 (no derivation in v0). |
| D-P2-23 | COMPLETION REVIEW group dispatched in parallel (review + uat + document); gates AOP.VALIDATE'd independently before dispatch | This document pass is the `document` strand of that group; §9 remains empty per north-star §COMPLETION CONDITION. |

## 3. Cucumber surface verification

The Cucumber Given/When/Then in `README.md` §3 (the north-star
business need) is the success contract. The table below maps each
clause to its evidence. The first agent-UAT pass against `4db9757`
exercised every row and surfaced the four AC violations now resolved
in §5.0. Rows whose verification still requires a visual count check
against live data are explicitly marked **Pending agent UAT walk-
through** below — those rows are mechanically correct in code
(component + integration tests pass; props wire to the named fields)
but were not visually counted in the first UAT pass.

### 3.1 Scenario 1 — User picks a recent match

| Clause | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Given user opens replay app in local browser | `apps/replay/README.md` quick-start (refreshed in `2833537` with Prerequisites + route descriptions); root `dev:replay` script; Vite serves `:5173`. |
| When they navigate to match list (`#/`) | `main.tsx:16-22` routes hash `#/` (or unrecognised) to `MatchPicker`. |
| Then paginated, reverse-chronological list of matches | `convex/replay.ts:43-52` `listMatches` uses `withIndex("by_status", "completed").order("desc").paginate(opts)`; `MatchPicker.tsx` renders via `usePaginatedQuery`. A local `PickerErrorBoundary` surfaces a friendly hint on `replay:listMatches` 404 (UAT ISSUE-003b). |
| And each row surfaces enough context | Columns: matchId (truncated 8ch), `startedAt` (ISO + relative), status, `match.turn`, `outcome.extracted.length`. The opaque `outcome.lastSurvivor` column was dropped per D-P2-21 / UAT ISSUE-004 (enrichment would require N+1 reads or a forbidden schema diff). |
| When click a row | `MatchPicker.tsx` row href is `#/match/<id>` (hash anchor, no JS handler needed). |
| Then navigate to replay view | `main.tsx:18-19` matches `kind === "replay"` route from `useHashRoute`. |

### 3.2 Scenario 2 — User steps through a match

| Clause | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Given replay loaded for completed match | `Replay.tsx` calls `client.query(api.replay.getReplayBundle, { matchId })` once on mount (no subscription). |
| Then bird's-eye 100×100 grid fits viewport | `Grid.tsx` SVG `viewBox="0 0 100 100"`; wrapped in `gridSquareStyle` (`Replay.tsx:419-428` — `aspect-ratio: 1/1` + `max-width: 100%` + `height: 100%`) inside a viewport-bounded main column so the grid is always square AND always fits — closure-readiness AC#4 / UAT ISSUE-001 (commit `2833537`). |
| And turn 0 is shown by default | `Replay.tsx` initial `currentTurn = 0`; `reconstruct(bundle, 0)` synthesises spawn-position snapshot per ADR §4. URL ↔ state sync via `useEffect([props.turn])` mirror at `Replay.tsx:51-54` honours browser back/forward + direct URL edits — closure-readiness AC#5 / UAT ISSUE-002. |
| And walls/cover/chests/corpses/evac/agents render | `Grid.tsx` z-ordered layers per ADR §4 walk (walls → cover → chests → corpses → evac → agents). Pending agent UAT for visual count check (≈28 walls, ≈60 cover tiles, 12 closed chests, 8 spawn agents, 3×3 evac ring at (47..49, 47..49)). |
| When click "next turn" or use slider | `TurnStepper.tsx` Next button + slider; both write `?turn=N` via `useHashRoute`. |
| Then grid updates | `Replay.tsx` derives snapshot via `useMemo(() => reconstruct(bundle, currentTurn))`. |
| And turn feed updates | `TurnFeed.tsx` reads `turnRowByTurn.get(currentTurn)` (D-P2-13 keying) and renders agent rows with `summariseDecision()`; collapsed rows show a one-line dimmed `scratchpadAfter` preview via `truncateOneLine(text, 100)` — closure-readiness AC#7 (`TurnFeed.tsx:316`). |

### 3.3 Scenario 3 — User inspects an agent's mind

| Clause | Evidence |
|---|---|
| When expand an agent's row in feed | `TurnFeed.tsx` "..." button mounts `ExpandModal` with `(agentRecord, characterById)`. |
| Then see persona prompt, scratchpadBefore/After, decision in English, visibleStateDigest | `ExpandModal.tsx` 5 tabs read `personaPromptText` (`:221`), `systemPromptText` (`:242`), `visibleStateDigest` (`:263`), `scratchpadBefore`/`scratchpadAfter` (`:283-284`), LLM trace (`:334+`). The LLM tab additionally surfaces a copyable parsed `agentRecord.decision` JSON section alongside `rawArguments` (`:353-356, :403-404`) — closure-readiness AC#9 / review-B Med-2. |
| When hover an agent token | `Grid.tsx` agent `<g>` mouseenter populates `HoverCard` with `HoverTarget` discriminated-union payload. |
| Then compact card with persona, hp, equipped, decision summary | `HoverCard.tsx` agent branch shows persona + displayName + position + alive/hidden + summary; hp/equipped render literal "see expand panel" per D-P2-11 (`HoverCard.tsx:230-231`). |
| When hover a chest | `Grid.tsx` chest `<g>` populates HoverCard chest branch. |
| Then see open/closed + contents | `HoverCard.tsx` closed chest shows id+pos+"closed"; opened chest shows id+pos+"opened (turn N)" + literal "contents not persisted" per D-P2-12 (`HoverCard.tsx:296`). |
| When hover a corpse | `HoverCard.tsx` corpse branch shows deceased character + persona + death turn + remaining loot from `worldState.corpses[]`. |

### 3.4 Caveat — agent UAT browser walk-through

A first agent-UAT pass against the implementation tip `4db9757` produced
two Med-blocking findings (Grid fit-to-viewport and URL↔state sync) plus
one onboarding-friction issue (Convex deployment prerequisites unclear)
— all four direct AC violations (`AC#4, AC#5, AC#7, AC#9`) were
resolved in the closure-readiness commit `2833537` per §5.0 below.

The COMPLETION REVIEW group (review + uat + document, dispatched per
D-P2-23) is running in parallel with this document pass. Findings from
that group's `uat` strand against `aee6397` are **not** integrated into
this record at sealing time — to avoid blocking on parallel jobs per
the assignment scope. If the COMPLETION REVIEW UAT raises new
high-severity findings they will be appended as a *Blocking findings*
section before the user starts §9; otherwise the user reads §9 fresh.

---

## 4. Substrate freeze verification

Per D-P2-9 the phase-1 substrate is frozen — phase 2 introduces no
diff to the engine kernels, the LLM wrapper, the per-match orchestrator,
the schema, the persona content, or the harness CLI.

```
$ git diff 7c22284..aee6397 -- convex/engine convex/llm convex/runMatch.ts convex/schema.ts personas harness
(no output)
```

Verified at sealing time (HEAD = `aee6397`). The only files touched in
`convex/` between dispatch and HEAD are `convex/replay.ts` (new module,
+92 lines) and the regenerated `convex/_generated/api.d.ts` (+2 lines —
the new module's typed surface). The closure-readiness commits
(`2833537` code+README and `aee6397` docs) touched **only** the renderer
sub-package and `docs/project/phases/02-replay-overseer-v0/*.md` —
neither commit modifies any substrate path.

---

## 5. Known caveats / known-issues

Each entry is tagged **resolved** (closure-readiness — fixed in
`2833537` or `aee6397`), **v0 acceptable** (intentional gap, surfaced
as literal copy in the UI) or **deferred** (downstream phase will
close it). No high-severity findings are open against this phase at
sealing time.

### 5.0 Closure-readiness fixes applied (resolved)

**Tag:** resolved (closure-readiness — landed in `2833537` + `aee6397`).

The first review-group pass (review × 3 reviewers + agent UAT against
`4db9757`) produced 4 AC-violating must-fix items + 5
lower-priority items. All 9 are addressed:

**AC-violating must-fix (4) — all resolved in `2833537`:**

- **AC#4 — Grid fit-to-viewport:** `Replay.tsx:419-428` adds
  `gridSquareStyle` (`aspect-ratio: 1/1` + `max-width: 100%` +
  `height: 100%`) inside a viewport-bounded main column. The grid is
  now always square and always fits. (UAT ISSUE-001.)
- **AC#5 — URL ↔ currentTurn sync:** `Replay.tsx:51-54` adds a
  `useEffect([props.turn])` mirror that pulls `useHashRoute` updates
  into local state on browser back/forward and direct URL edits.
  TurnStepper continues to write `?turn=N` via `replaceState`. (UAT
  ISSUE-002.)
- **AC#7 — Scratchpad preview on collapsed feed rows:** `TurnFeed.tsx`
  exports a new `truncateOneLine(text, budget)` helper (`:316`) and
  uses it at `:246` to render a one-line dimmed `scratchpadAfter`
  preview at ≤100 chars on collapsed rows. **+7 Vitest cases** in
  `apps/replay/src/components/__tests__/TurnFeed.test.tsx` cover
  boundary, exact-budget, ellipsis, newline-collapse, CRLF/tab
  collapse, run-of-whitespace collapse, and empty-string. (Review-B
  Med-1.)
- **AC#9 — Parsed `decision` JSON in ExpandModal:** `ExpandModal.tsx`
  LLM tab adds a copyable parsed-`agentRecord.decision` JSON section
  at `:353-356, :403-404` alongside the existing `rawArguments`. The
  centerpiece of concept-spec §2.4 (scratchpad-as-explainability) is
  now directly inspectable. (Review-B Med-2.)

**Lower-priority bundle (5) — resolved in `2833537`:**

- README route description refresh + new Prerequisites section
  documenting `npx convex dev` + `VITE_CONVEX_URL` (review-B Low; UAT
  ISSUE-003a). `apps/replay/README.md`.
- `MatchPicker.tsx` `PickerErrorBoundary` class component — friendly
  hint when `replay:listMatches` 404s on a deployment that has not yet
  pushed `convex/replay.ts` (UAT ISSUE-003b).
- Last-survivor column DROPPED from picker — D-P2-21 (UAT ISSUE-004).
  Enrichment would require N+1 `worldState` reads OR a schema diff
  forbidden by D-P2-9; the remaining columns satisfy AC#2.
- HoverCard speculative `useEffect` import + `void useEffect` hush
  comment removed (review-A nit).
- `de-risking.md` §1.8 wording aligned to `t >= extractedAtTurn` impl
  semantics with engine-source citation (D-P2-20; review-A Med-1).
- `de-risking.md` §1.7 RETIRED (not patched) — `reconstruct.ts`
  performs zero corpse-contents derivation and `HoverCard.tsx` reads
  `bundle.worldState.corpses[]` directly, so the feared
  derivation-vs-truth divergence has no surface. Parallels D-P2-12 for
  chests (D-P2-22; review-B Med-3).

Phase-2 sub-package test count went 115 → 122 in this slice. Root
`npm test` went 447 → 454 passing (4 LIVE_AZURE skips unchanged).

### 5.1 Live-agent equipment + HP not derivable per turn — D-P2-11

**Tag:** v0 acceptable.

**Surface.** Hover card on a live agent renders literal `"see expand
panel"` for the `hp` and `equipped` rows
(`apps/replay/src/components/HoverCard.tsx:230-231`).

**Why the gap exists.** The phase-1 substrate (frozen by D-P2-9) does
not persist per-turn HP on `agentRecords[]`
(`convex/schema.ts:262-271` carries no HP field) and the engine ledger
emits only the generic literals `"opened"` / `"looted"` for
`interact`/`loot` results (`convex/engine/resolution.ts:547,586`); no
`equipped_<item>` or `looted_<item>` strings carry item identity.

**User-facing fallback.** The expand modal's *Visible state digest* tab
surfaces `agentRecord.input.visibleStateDigest` — the agent's own view
of its equipped + HP at the start of the turn, captured per
`agentRecordValidator` (ADR §7). That digest is authoritative for the
agent's perspective and is sufficient for the vibe-judgement success
criterion.

**Resolution path.** Deferred to a downstream phase that revisits the
schema. Adding per-turn equipped + HP fields is a low-risk additive
schema diff but pre-pays a debugging surface the user has not asked for
in v0.

### 5.2 Opened-chest contents not persisted — D-P2-12

**Tag:** v0 acceptable.

**Surface.** Hover card on an opened chest renders literal
`"contents not persisted"` (`HoverCard.tsx:296`).

**Why the gap exists.** Engine clears `worldState.chests[i].contents`
to `null` when opening succeeds (`convex/engine/resolution.ts:537`).
The terminal `worldState.chests[]` therefore preserves only the
opened-flag; original contents are lost.

**User-facing fallback.** When an agent equips a chest item, the
side-panel feed surfaces it implicitly through the agent's `say` /
scratchpad delta on the same turn (the LLM tends to narrate equips).
Corpse contents — the other place loot identity matters — are
authoritative via `worldState.corpses[]`.

**Resolution path.** Deferred to a downstream phase. Two options
considered and rejected for v0: (a) re-running the loot RNG against
`match.rngSeed` in the renderer would import engine runtime across the
slice boundary (forbidden by architecture.md §1); (b) persisting
opened-chest contents would mean a schema diff (forbidden by D-P2-9).

### 5.3 Stale CLI counterpart vocabulary — `harness/analyze-match.ts`

**Tag:** deferred (phase-1 follow-up; not in phase-2 scope).

**Surface.** `harness/analyze-match.ts:49-58` references result-string
literals (`"hit"`, `"missed"`, `"killed"`, `"equipped_<item>"`,
`"looted_<item>"`) that the engine never emits. Per D-P2-14 the
canonical source is `convex/engine/resolution.ts:374-586` and the v0
renderer's vocabulary derives from there directly.

**Why this is documented here.** During the plan-refinement review
this drift was spotted and the renderer's vocabulary was anchored to
the correct source. The CLI tool itself is left alone (substrate
freeze applies; `harness/analyze-match.ts` was not required to change
for the v0 renderer to be correct). A future phase that updates the
CLI should refresh that vocabulary at the same time.

### 5.4 Deferred nits surfaced in closure-readiness reviews

**Tag:** deferred (closure-readiness reviews + UAT; not phase-2-blocking).

One-liner each, with file:line refs and review/UAT source citation.
Conscious deferrals — none gate phase-2 closure; tracked here so the
next phase that revisits these surfaces can address them.

- **Persona-colour palette duplicated across `Grid.tsx` and `TurnFeed.tsx`**
  (`apps/replay/src/components/Grid.tsx`,
  `apps/replay/src/components/TurnFeed.tsx`; review-A Med-2). Conscious
  choice — extract to a shared module on the third caller, not earlier.
- **Wall hover precision: NW-corner coordinate displayed for multi-tile
  walls** (`apps/replay/src/routes/Replay.tsx:105-109` TODO; review-A/C
  nit). Per-tile hover would require splitting wall geometry; deferred
  until user signals it impedes vibe-judgement.
- **HoverCard first-paint edge-clamp uses fallback dimensions before
  measuring** (`apps/replay/src/components/HoverCard.tsx:74-78`;
  review-A nit). Fallback `220 × 320` is used until the ref is
  measured; brief one-frame mis-clamp at first hover only.
- **UAT ISSUE-005 hover state-machine fragility** (UAT report).
  Test artefact — could not reproduce with normal mouse usage; logged
  for completeness pending real-world observation.

## 6. How to run

```bash
# 1. One-off install (sub-package has its own node_modules)
npm install --prefix apps/replay

# 2. Configure the dev Convex deployment URL
cp apps/replay/.env.example apps/replay/.env
# Edit `apps/replay/.env` and set:
#   VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<your-deployment-slug>.convex.cloud
# This is the same URL `npx convex dev` prints in the repo root.

# 3. Start the renderer (Vite dev server on :5173)
npm run dev:replay
# → http://localhost:5173/

# Optional: produce a static bundle (no deploy target — sanity only)
npm run build:replay
```

**Hash routes:**

- `#/` — match-picker page (paginated, completed-only,
  reverse-chronological).
- `#/match/<matchId>` — replay route at synthetic turn 0 (spawn
  positions).
- `#/match/<matchId>?turn=N` — replay route deep-linked to turn N.
  The slider hydrates from this; updates push history shallowly so the
  browser back button steps the slider.

**Convex deployment.** The renderer is read-only against the user's
own Convex dev deployment — no auth, no public deploy, no write paths.
Any matchId visible to `npx convex run replay:listMatches '{...}'` is
visible in the picker.

## 7. What this v0 unblocks

Mirror of `mental-model.md` §11 ("What this slice unblocks"):

- **Persona-behaviour intuition the closing report cannot show.** The
  user can now look at *why* `vulture` extracts at 42% (do they push
  hard, or do they out-survive?), *what* `trader`'s 1 583 speech
  events actually look like (lyrical or spammy?), *whether*
  `paranoid`'s 5-equip / 1 449-speech / 13-extract pattern is the
  evac-corner camp behaviour the post-Gate-2.5 tunings intended.
  Decisions about persona prompt-edits in the next phase can be made
  on observed-behaviour evidence, not just aggregate stats.
- **Cursed-item flavour-text moderation sense.** The user needs an
  intuition for how speech and item names *feel* in-context before
  authoring aggressive prompt-injection content. The replay overseer
  surfaces the speech feed alongside the agent's scratchpad delta,
  which is the substrate the cursed-item authoring loop will write
  into.
- **Eventual consumer-renderer specification.** v0 reveals which
  inspection surfaces are *load-bearing for understanding* a match
  (the side-panel feed, the visibleStateDigest, the scratchpad diff)
  versus which are *diagnostic-only* (full system prompt, raw LLM
  trace, copy-to-clipboard). The consumer renderer can replicate the
  former and drop the latter — but only after the user has used v0
  enough to know which is which.

## 8. Cross-references

Phase 2 documents that together form the full record:

- `README.md` — phase goal / scope / Cucumber surface / hard
  out-of-scope / dependency map.
- `architecture-decisions.md` — ADR §1..§12 capturing decisions
  D-P2-1..D-P2-14. D-P2-15..D-P2-23 are conversation Decision Record
  entries — orchestration / dispatch / closure-readiness level, not
  architecture; the §2 ADR adherence table above is the authoritative
  evidence index for those.
- `work-packages.md` — WP-A through WP-D scope, acceptance, test
  strategy, risks; "Closing the phase" §1-§3.
- `de-risking.md` — single load-bearing unknown
  (position-reconstruction correctness) decomposed into 9 enumerated
  failure modes, retired by Vitest tests in `reconstruct.test.ts`.
- `docs/project/spec/mental-model.md` §11 — phase 2 why-layer
  (read-only).
- `docs/project/spec/architecture.md` §1 / pillar 7 — slice
  boundary the renderer respects.
- `docs/project/phases/01-engine-and-harness/PHASE-1-CLOSURE.md` —
  phase-1 closure that this document mirrors.
