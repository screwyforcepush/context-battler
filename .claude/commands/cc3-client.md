Set up and start the workflow runner client in this project repo.

# What is the client?

This project repo is a **client** in the multi-agent orchestration system. The servers (CC2 + CC3) run elsewhere as a single shared instance. This client:

```
  Servers (shared, already running)          This Project (client)
  ┌────────────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────────┐

```

The **runner** is a long-lived daemon that subscribes to the Convex backend, picks up ready jobs for this project's namespace, spawns the appropriate agent CLI (`claude`, `codex`, or `gemini`), streams their output, and writes results back. Multiple project repos can each run their own runner against the same Convex backend.

# Key files

- Runner daemon: `.agents/tools/workflow/runner.ts`
- Config: `.agents/tools/workflow/config.json` (created from `config.example.json`)
- Init script: `.agents/tools/workflow/init.ts` (creates namespace in Convex)
- Harness executor: `.agents/tools/workflow/lib/harness-executor.ts`
- Stream handlers: `.agents/tools/workflow/lib/streams.ts`
- Job monitor TUI: `.agents/tools/agent-job/agent_monitor.py`
- Spec: `docs/project/spec/workflow-engine-spec.md`

# How agents are spawned

The runner spawns CLI processes per harness:

- **Claude:** `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose --output-format stream-json -p "<prompt>"`
- **Codex:** `codex --yolo e "<prompt>" --json`
- **Gemini:** `gemini --yolo -m gemini-2.5-pro --output-format stream-json "<prompt>"`

Each job gets environment variables: `WORKFLOW_ASSIGNMENT_ID`, `WORKFLOW_GROUP_ID`, `WORKFLOW_JOB_ID`.

# Setup Steps

## Step 1: Prerequisite check

## Python and UV
Ensure python and UV are installed in the system and install if not.
```bash
uv --version
```

### Convex
Check if convex is installed in the project.
```bash
ls node_modules/convex 
```
install as dev dep if not yet installed: `npm install -D convex`


Check which agent CLIs are installed and authed.

### Claude (required)
If you are reading this then claude is installed and authed!


### Codex (optional - OpenAI)
```bash
codex --version
codex e "is codex authed test: respond 'hello world'"
```
If not installed, `npm install -g @openai/codex` and ask the user to codex -> auth in terminal

### Gemini (optional - Google)
```bash
gemini --version
gemini -p "is gemini authed test: respond 'hello world'"
```
If not installed, `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@latest` and ask the user to gemini -> auth in terminal

Tell the user which harnesses are available and authed. If user only wants claude and none/one of the others this system will still work, just not as good quality outcomes.

## Step 2: Configure the client

Check if `.agents/tools/workflow/config.json` exists. If not, create it from the example:

```json
{
  "convexUrl": "<ask the user for their Convex URL - same one used in server setup>",
  "namespace": "<suggest the repo/directory name, ask user to confirm or change>",
  "password": "<the ADMIN_PASSWORD set in the Convex server - ask the user>",
  "timeoutMs": 3600000,
  "idleTimeoutMs": 600000,
  "harnessDefaults": {
    "default": "claude",
    "plan": "claude",
    "implement": "claude",
    "review": "claude",
    "uat": "claude",
    "document": "claude",
    "pm": "claude",
    "chat": "claude"
  }
}
```

**User has provided:** $ARGUMENTS




**Fields to ask the user about (if not provided):**
- `convexUrl`: The Convex deployment URL (cloud: `https://your-deployment.convex.cloud`, local: whatever `npx convex dev` outputs)
- `namespace`: Identifies this project in the workflow engine. Suggest the current directory name. Must match what they'll use in the Workflow Engine UI.
- `password`: The `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set on the Convex server. All Convex calls require this. Must match exactly.

update `.claude/settings.json` with the same namespace replace "claude-comms" in the sections `--source-app claude-comms`


## Step 3: Start the runner

Check if a runner or its wrapper is already running first (we do NOT want duplicates):

```bash
ps aux | grep 'runner.ts\|run-runner.sh' | grep -v grep
```

If one exists, ask the user if they want to restart it. Kill the wrapper (`run-runner.sh`) first, then the runner (`runner.ts`).

Start the runner via the auto-restart wrapper:

```bash
nohup bash .agents/tools/workflow/run-runner.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

The wrapper script (`run-runner.sh`) automatically restarts the runner if it exits (e.g. from SIGTERM during container recycle). Logs go to `/tmp/runner.log`.

Verify it started: `tail -20 /tmp/runner.log`

**If namespace not found in database:**
Initialise the namespace
This creates the namespace in the Convex database if it doesn't already exist:
```bash
cd .agents/tools/workflow && npx tsx init.ts
```

## Step 5: Tell the user they're ready

The client is now running and listening for jobs in the `<namespace>` namespace.

**How to use it:**
- Open the **Workflow Engine UI** (where the servers are running) to create threads, chat with the PO, and kick off work
- Monitor agent execution with the TUI: `uv run .agents/tools/agent-job/agent_monitor.py`
- Watch real-time observability at the **CC2 Dashboard** (http://localhost:5173)
- Check runner logs: `tail -f /tmp/runner.log`
