Update the workflow runner client with latest changes from upstream.

## Step 1: Stop the runner

Kill the wrapper and runner processes. SIGTERM does not reliably kill the `npm exec → tsx → node` tree (npm exec doesn't propagate signals, and runner.ts may trap SIGTERM for graceful shutdown and hang), so try SIGTERM first, then escalate to SIGKILL for any survivors:

```bash
pkill -TERM -f 'run-runner.sh' 2>/dev/null; pkill -TERM -f 'runner.ts' 2>/dev/null
sleep 3
pkill -KILL -f 'run-runner.sh' 2>/dev/null; pkill -KILL -f 'runner.ts' 2>/dev/null
sleep 1
```

Verify they're stopped (should print only `---done---`):
```bash
ps aux | grep -E 'runner\.ts|run-runner\.sh' | grep -v grep; echo '---done---'
```

If any processes remain after the SIGKILL pass, something external is respawning them — investigate before proceeding.

## Step 2: Pull latest changes

```bash
npx claude-comms
```

This pulls the latest client files from upstream.

## Step 3: Restore settings

The previous step overrides `.claude/settings.json` with defaults. Restore the project's version:

```bash
git restore .claude/settings.json
```

## Step 4: Update global CLI tools

```bash
sudo npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@latest
sudo npm install -g @openai/codex
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## Step 5: Restart the runner

```bash
nohup bash .agents/tools/workflow/run-runner.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Verify it started: `tail -20 /tmp/runner.log`

Tell the user the client has been updated and the runner is back online.
